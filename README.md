# WORK IN PROGRESS
MrSCL (Mega (rapid) Scientfic Computing Library) is a low-performance scientific computing library designed to provide bachelor students assistance with algebra, graph theory, linear algebra and numerical computations. It is an interpreted language, meaning it is quite slow, and doesn't compile its own code, instead opting for the portability of the JVM. MrSCL supports linear algebra through the matrix data structure, which itself supports element wise operations, dot products, transpose, inverse, nested matrices, etc. The language supports a unique graph data structure, which comes with its own built-in features, like getting the degree of a node, building directed, weighted graphs, etc. The key feature of this language is that it can do so using the unique math data type, which is meant to behave like algebra! MrSCL can therefore support matrices of the form: [[3, 6x, 7y], [4cos(x), ycos(y), log(x)]], although this is quite limited as of writing this. 

## Features
- Matrix data structure with support for element wise operations, dot products, transpose, inverse, nested matrices, etc.
- Graph data structure with support for directed, weighted graphs, degree of a node, etc.
- Math data type that can handle algebraic expressions.
- Basic numerical computations.
- Interpreted language for ease of use and portability.
- Simple syntax designed for beginners in scientific computing.
- Extensive documentation and examples to help users get started.
- Open-source
- Cross-platform compatibility through JVM.
- Support for basic statistical functions.
